# Predict_Doctors

* This project was done by medical college, Seoul National University, especially Prof Yun-chul Hong. All rights reserved.
* To be ready for the next 60 years, we need to predict demand and supply by various scinarios. 
* The scinarios are form the birth rate simulation done by Korean govornment. 
* I used the past medical demand per capita with different age to predict the demand.
* Also I predict the supply of medical services by predicting the number of admitted medcial students annually. 
* Instead of using machine learning or AI, I used basic statistical method, since there was no big data.
